  "body": "**STILL UNDER DEVELOPMENT**\r\n\r\n# Course Description\r\nParticipants in this four day course will learn how to use [the R software](https://www.r-project.org/) to perform basic statistical analyses with common fisheries data and analytical techniques.  Participants will learn how to customize R for their purposes, load data into R, manipulate data (e.g., filter, sort), construct simple summaries (basic statistics and cross-tabulations) and plots (histograms, bar charts, scatterplots), and use linear (simple and dummy variable regressions, one-way ANOVA, logistic regression) and nonlinear models, including how to compare among groups (e.g., sexes, morphotypes, or years).  Within these methods, participants will explore length and age frequencies, weight-length relationships, maturity-at-length relationships, growth models (length-at-age), catch curve mortality estimates, age-length keys, and population abundance estimates from mark-recapture data.  Course content will follow the descriptions in the [*Introductory Fisheries Analyses with R* book](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/) book, though this book is **not** required for this course.  Topic will be introduced with a short lecture followed by hands-on exercises that will largely use fisheries data from Nunavut.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of this course is to teach the use of R.  Thus, it will be assumed that participants have little to no experience with R, but a familiarity with basic to intermediate statistics (i.e., linear regression) and typical fisheries stock assessment data.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Pre-Course Preparation\r\n* Install at least version 3.3.0 of R on your laptop.  Directions for a first install are [here for Windows](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRWin.html) or [here for MacOS](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRMac.html).  If you are using Windows and already have R installed, then [here is an easy method to upgrade](http://www.r-statistics.com/2015/06/a-step-by-step-screenshots-tutorial-for-upgrading-r-on-windows/).\r\n* I prefer to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/) to interact with R (but RStudio is not required for this course).  Directions to install and prepare RStudio (along with a quick introduction to the RStudio interface) are [here for Windows](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioWin.html) and [here for MacOS](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallRStudioMac.html).\r\n* Install the `FSA`, `FSAdata`, `AICcmodavg`, `car`, `dplyr`, `multcomp`, `nlstools`, `nnet`, and `plotrix` packages for use in this course.  Directions for installing packages are [here if you plan to use RStudio](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallPackagesRStudio.html) and [here for Windows](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallPackagesRWin.html) and [here for MacOS](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/supplements/installations/InstallPackagesRMac.html) if you plan to use R directly.\r\n* Download all Slides, R Handouts, R scripts, and Exercises for the course (available individually below or [collectively in this ZIP archive](https://github.com/droglenc/RCourseNunavut2016/raw/master/RCourseNunavut2016.zip)).  I **highly recommend** printing all R Handouts for taking notes on during the workshop (and for reference after the workshop).\r\n* The materials for this workshop are based on my [*Introduction to Fisheries Analysis with R*](http://derekogle.com/IFAR/) book (IFAR).  This book is NOT required for the workshop.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n# Course Materials\r\n1. Introduction to R and RStudio\r\n    * Slides\r\n1.
